<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Movie is all about the creative mindset of one of the visionary directors the hollywood has, Mr Christopher nolan. Its a complete package if you want to experience something out of the ordinary.</p>

<h3>The Prestige</h3>
<p>This is a fantabulous movie revolving around the magical abilities or the attributes a person can have and the differences that it wouold make in the society even if it is going against the true friendship.</p>

<h3>Bruce ALmighty</h3>
<p>Can't put this out of the list as it has all the magical elements or the comedy one can ask for and experience. Starcast involves one of the best actors of all time, Jim Carry who is also famous for his versatality in portraying such difficult characters. </p>
